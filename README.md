# Describe your project (unfinished)
## Datasets
I will primarily be using the Homicide Reports, 1980-2014 dataset. I can also get extra data from the Homicides database. Both of these are on kaggle.
## Project Explanation
The goal is to predict what kind of people are most likely going to be murdered next as well as the perpetrator
## Flows & Actions
There will be a flow to load the data, to preprocess the data, to train the data and to test the data.  
In the first flow there will be seperate tasks to load the data and to save the data
