# Describe your project (unfinished)
## Datasets
I will primarily be using the Homicide Reports, 1980-2014 dataset. I can also get extra data from the Homicides database. Both of these are on kaggle.
## Project Explanation
The goal is to predict what kind of people are most likely going to be murdered next as well as the perpetrator
## Flows & Actions
There will be a flow to load the data, to preprocess the data and one to train the model/ test the model.
In the first flow there will be seperate tasks to load the data and to save the data.  
The second flow will have a task to load the data, a task to preprocess the data and a task to store the changed data.  
The train flow will have a task to load the data, to train the model and to test the model, there would also be one to save the model.
